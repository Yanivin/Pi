`Pi is an educational software developed to educate young students about different components of the sciences and mathematics. Pi is a game, it is a tutor and also it has subject-specific tutors like chemistry, physics etc. the game aims at making learning fun for students by involving them in fun activities like solving puzzles, adding new games to their libraries, editing tutorials.`
